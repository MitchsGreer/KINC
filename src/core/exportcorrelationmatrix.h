 * This class implements the export correlation matrix analytic. This analytic
 * takes two data objects, a correlation matrix and a cluster matrix, and writes
 * a text file of correlations, where each line is a correlation that includes
 * the pairwise index, correlation value, and sample mask, as well as several
 * other fields which are not used but are required for this format. The analytic
 * attempts to recreate these fields as much as is possible. The expression matrix
 * that was used to produce the correlation matrix must also be provided in order
 * to recreate sample masks for pairs with only one cluster, as these sample masks
 * are not stored in the cluster matrix.
